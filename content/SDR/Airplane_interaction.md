## Setting up the scanner 
I followed a [tutorial]('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBVU6DTZq-k') on how to setup a radio freqency scanner. 
It's a really clear video. So if you want to do the same you can defenitely follow along that video.

A radio scanner allows scanning through a range of radio frequencies and finding the ones that go over a
predefined dB (decibels) threshold. If you set it to -60dB for example all the frequencies are matched 
going above this. 

I live very close to Brussels airport, so I could pick up all these airplanes during their final approach. 
The most active one, at that time, was: 118,250 Mhz.

## Radio frequencies BRX

After finding the freqency which was very active, I asked myself the question: "What are all the different "
One Google search later and I found a website which provides the following table:

| 132.475 |   | BM | CSQ | ATIS          | ATIS                       | AM | Aircraft  |
|---------|---|----|-----|---------------|----------------------------|----|-----------|
| 130.550 |   | BM | CSQ | AbelagUnicom  | Abelag Unicom              | AM | Aircraft  |
| 118.250 |   | BM | CSQ | Approach      | Approach                   | AM | Aircraft  |
| 120.100 |   | BM | CSQ | Approach      | Approach                   | AM | Aircraft  |
| 122.500 |   | BM | CSQ | AMC Civil     | Approach Military Crossing | AM | Aircraft  |
| 121.950 |   | BM | CSQ | Clearance Del | Clearance Delivery         | AM | Aircraft  |
| 126.625 |   | BM | CSQ | Departure     | Departure                  | AM | Aircraft  |
| 127.575 |   | BM | CSQ | Final 25L     | Final 25L                  | AM | Aircraft  |
| 129.725 |   | BM | CSQ | Final 25R     | Final 25R                  | AM | Aircraft  |
| 118.050 |   | BM | CSQ | Ground        | Ground                     | AM | Aircraft  |

Maybe it's an idea for in the future to tune into all these at once. The same youtuber has a video on how to setup
listening to multiple frequencies at once. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwJqbt85XIA)
Here however we have a problem because the maximum sample size of the device I use to monitor the radio frequencies is 
limited to 3.2 Mhz. So in order to do this we will have to order a few more of these devices. 

## Result
I made a little youtube video if you want to check out this little interaction.
