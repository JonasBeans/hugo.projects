## Starting 
After finding out the antenna that comes with the SDR is magnetic, a new project idea was brewing in my head. Would it be possible to make a mini radio station by attaching the atenna to a piece of metal and making a portable system with everyting it needs. Well here we are testing if the idea in my head is viable or just another wild dream. :)

These are all the components used for this project. A wooden beam to attach the whole system on. A Raspberry Pi as the...

## Result
I'm really happy with the final result. And it didn't take that long either! It's a simple solution with a big advantage. The whole system is very portable so if I ever need to change the location it's possible. The first scenario that pops into my head is looking for the optimal place for the best signal.
